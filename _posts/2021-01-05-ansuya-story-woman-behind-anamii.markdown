I am Indian, was born in the USA, shortly after which my family moved back to India, where I spent most of my life so far. Introverted and reclusive by nature, I spent most of my childhood by myself, writing poems, making art and learning Science. I had a happy childhood, but like many of you, witnessed problems in my family, primarily of which being my mother’s declining health. I left for the USA where I pursued a Masters in Computer Science, and then went on to work for the biggest tech company in Silicon Valley. During those years, I would travel to India and spent every visit making rounds of the hospital for my mother. Witnessing her declining health and eventual demise, along with other close members of her family, I did not realize that it had negatively impacted my mental health considerably.

When it finally dawned on me that the random physical ailments that had begun to crop up in me were a result of my mental mess up, I decided to take the matter into my own hands. My mother always encouraged me to do Yoga so that I would not have the same health problems as she did. However it never really stuck with me until now. In June 2013, without having almost any experience of meditation, I went for a 10-day intensive Vipassana meditation retreat. From 4:30am in the morning till 9pm at night, day after day, all we did was meditated. We were not allowed to speak or even look at anyone else. This has till date been the hardest thing I ever had to do. At the time I went for this retreat, my mental state was totally haywire - I was knee deep in anxiety and had lost connection with the outside world. I had no sense of belonging and perhaps no positive emotions left in me. On the 10th day of the retreat, I realized suddenly everything around me looked like a 4K HD movie. I was calmer and life around me was brighter. However I wasn’t fully rid of anxiety. It still took me several years more of continuously unconditioning my mind and trying different Yogic practices, to finally feel at ease with myself. For my physical and mental health, I tried several yogic practices and energy healing techniques - Iyengar Yoga, all other forms of popular Yoga in different countries and cities. Each practice I did was important for the period I was in, in my life. Today, I do mostly practices I learnt from the Isha school of Yoga, apart from few other things like showing gratitude and sometimes journaling. 2020 has been the most transformative year for me. It has brought me such profound experiences and realizations, that a woman like me, who was all about logic and so called intelligence has now moved and surrendered to the cosmic will of the divine. 

As I worked on my spiritual development, other aspects of my life also began demanding a shift. In 2017, I no longer felt like living in the USA and no longer felt like working for that tech giant. A part of me has always craved to find meaning, and to devote my time and energies in what brought meaning to my life. I knew I wanted to start a venture of my own, perhaps use tech in organic farming in India, but again had no clue how to do so. Instead, an opportunity came to move to Switzerland and work in a small IT services company. I did that for the last 3 years but again that voice inside me kept looking for meaning, kept telling me this is not it.

When I started my instagram page (now called @anamiiofficial) during the lockdown this year, I did not know that this is what I would end up doing with it. At the time, it was simply to share all the knowledge and experience I had gained over the years, with others. About 6 months ago, I met someone who made me realize that what I was doing with my life and what I was meant to do, were not in alignment. The next day, the idea to build Anamii just started pouring in during my morning meditation. I decided to quit my job and pursue this full time. 

Over the last 4 months, I spent time talking to several people, especially women from different cities and countries globally, trying to understand what are the challenges in their spiritual journey and if there is a need that I can help meet. I took a survey few months ago, where I found that half of you are seeking like-minded people and curated spiritual guidance from authentic, experienced and trustworthy people. I wanted to give you a way to get individual access to spiritual guides, because not all of us have access to a living guru. You told me you have tried many platforms, but either found them to be too fast-paced, too impersonal or simply not trustworthy. So now, all I am doing with my solution, is to help resolve exactly these pain-points. I have contacted many guides with inspiring life stories and remarkable experiences, who want to offer their services to you with their highest intentions. These are monks, yogis and spiritual coaches who come from strong lineages and with in-depth experience. They are personally vetted and hand picked by our team. We have a small team, across the USA, India and Switzerland, that is building this platform. 

With the Anamii platform, you will simply sign up, answer our questions and we will match you to the right guides for 1:1 sessions. You will have the opportunity to have free introductions with each of them to see what fits best for you. It is very important to know that not everything fits everyone. We all have different genetic and energetic make-up and therefore we need to work on ourselves in the way that aligns the best with us. This can be a tiresome process, but we hope to give you some relief in this process. I have heard from many people that they felt like nothing worked for them and they simply gave up and went on in their self destructive ways. This should not be the case at all. Each of one us has the ability to awaken to our fullest and highest potential. Each one of us is sooner or later meant to spiritually awaken. 
 
Our mission is to raise global consciousness and whatever we do here on forth will be to make this mission a reality. 

Without transforming individual lives, there will be no transformation in the world.
