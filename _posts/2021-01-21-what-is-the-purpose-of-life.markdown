What is the purpose of life?

Can anyone really answer that? And if someone were to answer it, how would you know if it’s the right answer?

<img style="float:right; padding:20px" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blog2-image2.jpeg" width="360">

If you give a child an ice cream, he quickly lovingly and happily eats it. If you give him maybe bitter gourd (karela in hindi) or broccoli, he asks WHY do I have to eat it? What’s the purpose behind me having to eat this vegetable? He does not ask this question about eating the ice cream. Why is that?

Simply, the ice cream is enjoyable. He’s too busy relishing the ice cream to ask the questions about it’s origins or end. At the same time the same questions about the origins and the ends of the ice cream may come into play, if he develops a deep love and passion for the ice cream.

And the child who asks about the purpose of bitter gourd, is not interested in the answer. He simply doesn’t want the bitter gourd.
And the child who asks about the origin of ice cream is not satisfied by an answer, he’ll want to see the ice cream factory.

So the question is, which child are you?
Are you the child who is hating this life and wondering out of misery what the purpose of life is?
Or Are you the child entrenched in passion, wondering out of the beauty before your eyes, where it starts and where it ends?
Or are you unaffected by both and curious about the nature of it?

The answer to each of those questions is different.
Because if you wish to be here, and try to know that, it takes a different kind of mind, emotion, body and energy to do such things.

To answer these things verbally cannot convey the immensity of what life is.
It’s like asking what is the taste of sugar? No amount of description can do justice to simply the experience of tasting sugar.
And any description only gives you the illusion of knowing what sugar tastes like, it does not give you the knowledge of the taste itself.

Such is the nature of life.
So the question must evolve from what is its nature to how to know it.

And the answer to that, can be brought forth if you become willing to invest some time and life to find it.
