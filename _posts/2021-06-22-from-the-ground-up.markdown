In the part of the world where I grew up, Tamil Nadu, Southern part of India, there is a long history and tradition of bowing down and touching the Guru’s and elders' feet to get their blessing. This is to honor the feet of the being that lives on this realm.

The earth is the beginning of the journey; it is the birthplace, the primal source, the womb from which all living things emerge and to which, in time, they return. Like a plant seedling breaking ground, like the bones of the body growing upward to stand or the rising cobra, the human spirit evolves through vertical ascent.

Understanding the mechanics of your feet in yoga and the patterns in your foot health is the first step to establishing a solid foundation in your practice. Structurally, the feet support the body and are the source for numerous nāḍīs and meridian channels. The soles of the feet underpin all bodily systems, so that posturally, all weight- bearing forces are borne by the feet. The feet must be balanced and sturdy to support the legs, spine, arms, and head. If our base is tilted or collapsed, it will be reflected up through the body as distortion or misalignment.

The body is like a tree is one of the oldest analogies in yoga. In the tree metaphor, the toes and feet nourish the body in the same way that the roots of a tree draw water, nutrients, and minerals out of the ground in order to support the vitality of the trunk, branches, and leaves. In turn, the spine supports the growth of the arms and hands like a tree trunk supports the branches and leaves. Ultimately the roots of the feet help metabolize prāṇa by remotely providing support to fine twiglike structures within the lungs (bronchioles) together with their alveoli leaf clusters.

By establishing an extensive root system through the feet—stretching the plantar fascia, spreading the metatarsal bones, broadening the heel, and lifting the arches of the feet—we provide structural organization for the entire body.

The practice of yoga postures can transform our relationship with our feet. Practicing barefoot, we develop greater feel for the ground below. As we become more intimate with our feet, they also become stronger and more mobile. Most yoga students can testify that their feet grow in length over the course of a sustained practice. When we begin yoga, we have little idea how confined and restrained our feet have been over the years. Distorted feet can have a negative emotional impact on the body.

As we free up our feet, we tap into a reservoir of potential energy. It is as if we are standing on wellsprings of life force that have been blocked by years of constrictive footwear, lack of use, and inhibition. We may be required to do a fair amount of “mining, But this mining pays off eventually by uncovering sources of energy that can keep us vital and fluid through years of practice.
