Recently I received a postcard with something written on it by the Dalai Lama. I mean, the card
was not sent by the Dalai Lama, but it had a statement of the Dalai Lama on the front picture of a
beautiful lotus. There it said:

"Sometimes it's a great luck to not get what you want!"

A thought provoking message! But there seems to be a contradiction here. How can we say that it
is a great luck to not get what we want? Usually we understand the opposite to be true - If I only
would get this or that, then I will be happy! And if I do not get it I will feel miserable! I will be happy
if I meet with this girl, I will be happy if I have a better job, if I earn more money, if I get this car or that new electronic device.

But this is a very limited and materialistic understanding, and very typical for our modern consume
oriented civilization. We think happiness depends on doing or possessing something outside of
ourselves, when in reality, true happiness is a state of being to be found within ourselves.

The way we understand happiness has a lot to do with how or what we identify ourselves with. The
identification we have determines the way we think and desire. As long as I identify with this body, I
naturally want to gratify my senses. When I realize that I am not the body, but a soul within the
body, I take a different approach. 

Of course, the bodily needs are there and they have to be taken care of, but it's not the all in all.
The body has needs, it requires food, it requires sleep and there is need for protection and for
sexual expression, that’s natural. But as a spiritual being, as a soul, I also have needs. That need
is called atma dharma, the dharma, or nature of the soul. Dharma means that which cannot be
separated from something, that which is constantly existing with a particular object. Fire, for
example, cannot be separated from the quality of light and heat. Sugar will always be sweet and
the nature of chilli is to be hot. Similarly, that which is the true nature of the soul is called bhagavat
dharma. And what is that? To be connected in a loving relationship with the Divine and to express
that devotion through service to the Supreme, that’s what the soul is striving for. This need requires
attention, if we only care for the external body but neglect the actual self we can't achieve true
satisfaction.

Srila Prabhupada gave the example of the bird in a golden cage. If you clean the golden cage
daily, but neglect the bird inside, not providing any food and water, nor attention and love, that bird
will die soon. Similarly, if we only care for our bodily needs, but neglect the requirements of the
soul we kill our spiritual life. Self-realization means to understand the difference between the body
and our true self and act accordingly. Spiritualists, in other words, will be satisfied with whatever is
needed to maintain their body and by prioritizing spiritual life, they will acquire the wealth of true
inner peace and satisfaction. After all, it’s the person who can tolerate the incessant flow of desire,
who achieves peace, and not the one who strives to satisfy such desires.

With this understanding the Dalai Lama’s statement makes sense: "Sometimes it's a great luck to
not get what you want!"

It means that whenever we forget our spiritual nature, whenever we overly identify with the body
and desire more sense gratification than we actually require, at that time it becomes our good
fortune if we do not get what we want!
