In relation to Covid-19, Prof. Marcel Salathé, a well-known epidemiologist of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, remarked in a national TV interview: “What is true for everybody is also true for scientists: We don’t know the truth. We just interpret it in our own way.”

This is honest. Unfortunately, too many claim that they ‘possess the truth’ – politicians, religionists, academics and people in general. Believing to be right – and the other party to be wrong – leads not only to heated debates, but also to fights and even war. Dogmatism is always an aspect of the false ego – arrogance and ignorance. 

Different ideas, opinions and convictions are natural in this world. It would be boring if everybody thinks and believes the same: “Variety is the spice of life.” However, we don’t need to fight that only “we own the truth”. Yet, everyone should be given the opportunity to explain their personal views and perspectives.


<p><strong>The same is not the same</strong>
<br>We may see or hear the “same” thing, but everybody sees and hears something different. Our brain is selective. What we see and believe depends on our education, personal experiences, individual nature, our intelligence, expectations, our association and our surroundings.

<br><br>Our nature is our character. People who tend to be fanatical, also find fanatic statements in scriptures, etc. – and make them their prime belief - “You see, here it is clearly stated what has to be done!” Whereas, others who have a more mild and balanced nature, may see the same dogmatic spots in a text, and rather stick to phrases which encourage a softer and more merciful approach.

<br><br>Let’s look at another aspect and reason for this: our intelligence. One quality of intelligent people is that they are not stubborn and don’t limit themselves to their ‘truth’. They are open to question their personal beliefs and – if necessary – replace old and irrelevant insights with up-to-date knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p><strong>It’s not easy</strong>
<br>One big challenge is to differentiate what is relative knowledge and what is axiomatic. The same is true for sacred texts. For dogmatic people, everything in a holy book is eternal truth, whereas others understand that time, place and circumstances are relative, and come with limited knowledge.

<br><br>How to differentiate one from the other? All we have are our limited personal tools: our intelligence, our experiences, our heart and our faith. Even scientists have confirmed that their expectations influence the result of their research work and experiments.</p>


<p><strong>Faith</strong>
<br>Ultimately, it all depends on what we believe. We may have faith in scientists, prophets, saintly people, scriptures or just in ourselves. It is subjective and relative. The Bhagavad-Gita, India’s well-known spiritual scripture, states it as follows: “One’s faith expresses one’s own nature. A person is made of faith and faith makes a person.” [17.3]

<br><br>A Christian priest once gave a lecture, entitled: “Which Religion is the Best?” Right at the beginning, he gave the answer: “It is very simple – mine.” Then he paused for a moment before he continued: “For me. For someone else, their religion or faith is.”</p>


<p><strong>Individual paths</strong>
<br>Here is another verse from the Bhagavad-Gita. For many of India’s religious traditions, Krishna embodies the supreme Deity. He says: “As people approach me, I reveal myself to them. All beings everywhere are on my path.” [4.11]

<br><br>So, if there’s a God, he manifests himself the way we open ourselves to him, love him, devote ourselves to him – like the physical law of action and reaction; cause and effect.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br>All we actually have are our own experiences, our common sense, our intelligence and our heart. This means that whatever we believe, whatever we ‘know’ is nothing more than our personal faith. This also corresponds with the Sanskrit word shraddha, which can be translated as ‘faith’. The root of shraddha comes from hridaya – the heart. What is in our hearts are our innermost, intimate feelings, our beliefs. Yet what the heart can sense, understand and ‘know’ is often much more than what our brain and logic can grasp. 

<br><br>So, let’s use all these wonderful gifts that we’ve received as human beings: intelligence, mind, heart and soul. And let’s understand that we are only able to grasp one small part of the vast, multi-dimensional, deep truth. Yet, whatever we may understand is a precious gift and a wonderful treasure of our human existence. It should be nourished as long as we live – with respect to the different views our brothers and sisters have in this world.</p>
