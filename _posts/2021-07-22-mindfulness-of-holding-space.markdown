Wishing mom on her 80th birthday, when I hugged her, she softly whispered, “You’ve taken such good care of me all these years. I got more than I could’ve asked for, and feel truly content. Today I want to declare that this year I’m ready to go to daddy.” My dad had passed away more than twenty years ago.

That moment suddenly took me through a roller-coaster of emotions. How I wanted to tell her she shouldn’t say that, especially on her birthday! But as I looked at her face, all I could see there was sheer joy, peace, fulfillment, and the excitement like that of a teenager to go and be with her love. 

Mom had been having major health issues for several years and was often in immense pain, yet she didn’t say she was tired of life. Instead, she had created this journey to a destination that felt exciting to her. What a level of acceptance and awareness! 

In that moment I told myself, "Can I simply take over the role of holding space for her?"

Being accustomed to holding space for my Life Coaching clients, I am aware what an incredibly profound experience it is. I had to now operate from a space of being neutral, empathetic, and non-judgmental. With mindful awareness I had to just trust and respect mom’s choices for her own life, and offer her selfless providing. Asking my often compulsive ‘take charge’ attitude, as well as my identity to take a back seat, I decided to just be. Honestly it was often not easy and I experienced umpteen weak moments. So it became imperative that I hold space for my own self simultaneously, and focus on self-care too. Few months later, mom moved on. 

The role of holding space is simply phenomenal as one’s energy field expands to include the other person as a part of themselves - extending completely unconditional and unsolicited support to the person. You are co-creating with the other while being a silent witness to what is. 

Holding space for the other is something we all may be doing at some point without even realizing it. Though it may seem there is no specific technique required here, yet we need to be aware that it is a proper science. It takes a good amount of practice with responsible and committed handling. 

This experience made me aware of the need to practice holding space at our work environment as much as in the personal arena. I strongly feel this has become all the more important today than it ever was. Can we all inculcate this attribute of holding space for others?

This seemingly ORDINARY ACTION has the potential to create EXTRAORDINARY OUTCOMES.

<strong>Here are some broad guidelines for practicing ‘Holding Space’:</strong>
<li>Be inclusive
<li>Have deep listening
<li>Let go of your controls
<li>Be non-judgmental and empathetic
<li>Encourage people to be their authentic selves
<li>Be in mindful awareness
<li>Be willing to accept the other in a space beyond right or wrong
<li>Create a safe space for others to express freely
<li>While focusing on the other, take good self-care

<br><br>While holding space, you will be extending unconditional and even unsolicited support. That does not mean you need to have all the answers to their problems. It simply means you are engaging with them authentically and are present for them.

<br><br>It is indeed a privilege and blessing when one gets the opportunity of holding space for someone. What an enlightening experience when you are apparently doing nothing, yet doing everything by simply playing the role of a catalyst.
