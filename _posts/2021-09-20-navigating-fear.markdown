As an ambitious young man looking for his place in the world, I went to university and studied Commerce. In the pursuit of success, I worked hard, studying, partying, joining a Board at 21, merging two organisations, undertaking internships, studying exchange in the U.S, and travelling the world.

The adrenal fatigue became too much and forced me to look deeper and so at this point, I hired my first health coach. He helped open my mind, body, and spirit to new realms of possibilities. I soon realised I lacked mind/body awareness. I started meditating, practising yoga, and experimented with nutrition, psychology, and philosophy. You name it. I had a gap year and as I went deeper, I explored emotions, participated in men’s work, started a social enterprise focussed on mental health, and participated in entrepreneurship accelerator programs.
 
Then 1 year later, I started my ‘dream job’ to become a management consultant ‘solving the world’s most important problems with the smartest people and making lots of money’. And then burnout started to creep in again. I knew that work was out of alignment. I knew I had a unique ability with people, but I was spending 60 hours on an Excel spreadsheet and PowerPoint. My body was talking to me, but I wasn’t listening. Everything I had done during my years of study was for this job, my friendships were in this industry, and it was my financial security. The reality was that I wasn’t being responsible for living my truth.
 
Then one day I met a mentor who changed my life. I completed my first group personal development program. I got so impacted that I resigned from my corporate job the next day. This was one of the greatest acts of self-love and I’ve never looked back since.

My journey since then has been filled with fulfilment and passion doing what I love every day. I’ve travelled the world and healed relationships with family. Today, I am enjoying the benefits of this with abundance, financially, relationally, emotionally and in my wellbeing.

The journey I have been on since has been nothing short of magic. This journey has included (but is not limited to) learning and working in teaching, facilitation, personal development, communication, embodiment, yoga, integral energetics, rites of passage, men’s work, Vedic meditation, reiki, intuition, self-awareness, visioning, empowered choice making, permaculture, music, business, and sexuality.

I am living proof that you have the power to live in your purpose and alter your life’s path. However, it doesn’t mean that shedding my security blanket and leaving the financial security my corporate job provided me wasn’t terrifying. Discovering how to navigate times of fear and uncertainty was something that helped me immensely and, in today’s climate, it’s more important than ever that we learn to traverse these times whilst taking care of our energy and staying aligned with our purpose.
 
Our world is rapidly changing; even before the pandemic, society felt divided. Everyone had their own lives, the wheel was turning so fast, and many were running with it scared that if they slowed down, they might fall off. Politics divided the country, as did race and religion. Many didn’t have the time, or for some even the desire, to act on the things that no longer served them. Rumours of a deadly virus began to swirl in early January, and the fear of the looming pandemic added to a long list of things that turned people against one another. Globally, while many have lost livelihoods, family and friends, the lasting effects of the pandemic remain to be seen. The climate and society we are currently living has created space for feelings of fear and uncertainty to creep in, and so it is unsurprising that many are left feeling without purpose, lost, drained of energy and motivation.
 
However, always remember that your experience of life and the world is correlated to where you choose to give your energy in any moment. I was fortunate enough to have learned how to navigate times of fear and uncertainty, whilst taking care of my energy and staying aligned with my purpose before the pandemic hit; but many had not. I don’t have all the answers but here are some of the things that have helped me:

1. Find peace in the chaos & come back to your joy & simplicity - otherwise you’ll get swept in the chaos

2. Do NOT fight a fight you can’t win. What resists, persists. Know yourself. Be wise & invest your energy in creating.

3. QUESTION everything & remain righteous in your Truth. Money, Greed, Power, Oppression & Control has existed in every civilisation throughout human history just in different technology paradigms. Black rights, women, Indigenous, slavery, war all the way back to Ancient Egypt.

4. Meditate, breath & ground in Nature. The Earth is here to support you.

5. This is a great opportunity to develop your EQ. Feel your emotions, learn to process them, and allow yourself to heal generations of suppressed trauma NOW.

6. Come back to Compassion & BE KIND to everyone - even if you don’t agree with them. You’ll get back what you put out.

7. TAKE RADICAL SELF RESPONSIBILITY for your life. This isn’t the time to feel helpless. Get back up. Get support. Create. It’s time to take ownership.

8. Remember you are a channel for Source. Just like the mycelium network, we are interconnected multi-dimensional beings. YOU ARE PART OF THIS. YOU MATTER!

I’m not saying this is easy, but it is worth it; two things that are often parallel with one another.
 
<strong>“All the best things are terrifying, but that’s why they’re the best things. Nothing worth having comes easy. You have to be afraid to want it, afraid to lose it, afraid to try. If you feel that, then you know you’re onto a winner.” – Thomas S. Monson</strong>
 
Our energy is drained when we fight our own thoughts; learn how to take care of your energy and live in your passion and purpose – every single day. As a facilitator and coach, I have worked with close to 5,000 people empowering them mentally, emotionally, and spiritually to experience higher states of freedom, peace and fulfilment in their life, work, and relationships.
 
It is my mission to help people self-heal and consciously create the life they dream to live.
 
I have collated my life’s work into the “Live Your Greatness” 12-week Self-Mastery group coaching program to support heart-led humans in actualising their potential.
 
This program will provide you with the process, resources, and structures to set you up for success and enable you to begin living your passion and purpose every single day! This powerful life changing program will support you in developing self-mastery in 12 core areas of your life:
