Practically everyone knows the term ‘karma’, often translated as ‘fate’. Karma literally means an action which causes a reaction – it refers both to the cause and its effect. In physics, there is a similar understanding.

The concept of karma is found in almost all religions and in many philosophies. “As you sow, so you shall reap” (Bible). Karma is not limited to external activities alone. It also applies to the subtle, inner motivation. The following statement is sometimes credited to Buddha, but also to Confucius, as well as to the Talmud, the Jewish texts of wisdom: “Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Watch your words, for they become actions. Watch your actions, for they become habits. Watch your habits, for they become character. Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.”

As karma is a law, we can similarly talk of a law in relation to dharma. This means: if I don’t fulfil my dharma, then I won’t become happy, no matter how fortunate I appear in society, where money and fame are generally considered a sign of success.

<strong>What is dharma?</strong>
<br/>Eknath Easwaran (1910–1999), a spiritual teacher from India, author and professor of English literature, describes the word as follows: “Dharma is the universal law which holds all life together in unity. Dharma means many things, but its underlying sense is ‘that which supports’, from the Sanskrit root dhri – to hold up or bear. Generally, dharma is the essence 
of something, its virtue, that which makes it what it is.”

On a larger scale, dharma means the essential order of things, an integrity and harmony in the universe and the affairs of life that cannot be disturbed without creating chaos. Dharma also means rightness, justice, goodness, purpose, rather than chance. In other words: dharma is not a whimsical activity, but a duty, as all living entities (plants, animals and humans) have their distinct assignments to fulfil. 

Nowadays, there is much talk about ‘bio diversity’. It has become obvious that once living beings are extinct – be they ‘just’ weeds or small insects – the proper balance of the planet is disturbed, as other beings can’t fulfil their required tasks anymore.

<strong>Dharma is personal and individual</strong>
<br/>Dharma is different for all species of life. How can I know my own dharma? First of all, dharma is always service to others – to society, to animals, to nature, etc. Second: it is performed according to one’s nature and skills. Everyone has unique individual strengths, things he or she can do better than others.

As soon as two people live or work together (what to speak of a society), the individual responsibilities have to be assigned. Ideally, it is based on one’s personal abilities. We need to be, of course, practical, especially when there is an emergency. But in the long run, we will face a ‘burn out’ if we can’t use our skills and have to act against our nature.

What goes rather smoothly for us and gives us happiness is often a clue of our dharma. However, if we want to become an expert in our field, it is not enough to be skilled. Hard and smart work are still required in order to advance in our dharma. History has revealed many unfortunate examples of skilled people who were lazy and thus didn’t find joy and fulfillment in their life.

<strong>How to find one’s personal dharma?</strong>
<br/>If we know our nature and our abilities, we also know our dharma. I may be a specialist or a generalist – the world requires many different talents. Yet, it is crucial that our skills are a requirement in society and help the planet and its inhabitants to improve in their existence.

What is my nature? Am I more of an extraverted or an introverted person? Introverted people are generally calm, quiet workers and do not like much attention from others. They rather wish to be undisturbed to be able to concentrate on their duties. This can be simple manual work, a technical job, an artistic and creative task, an academic and scientific profession, preaching, coaching, etc.

Extraverted persons like to be in the center of attention; they need to be noticed by others and derive energy through them. Outgoing people like fancy dresses, big cars, luxurious houses, etc. – whatever creates awareness of them. They love to talk and are smart business people, successful bankers and passionate sales persons. Extraverted men and women are often leaders, hold executive jobs, are managers, CEOs, military people, politicians, etc.

A mix is also possible: being both extraverted and introverted. This would then mean that both aspects would have to be nourished. For example: you can be a carpenter and at the same time manage your own business. 

In due course of time, one’s dharma can change – from extraverted to more introverted. After having done active business work for several decades, as you get older, you may prefer less stressful activities – and you will then act as a consultant, business advisor, etc.

Whoever you are, whatever you do – you should be aware that challenges remain a part of life. But when you understand and fulfill your dharma, you will feel in your heart that you do the right thing, not wasting your God-given skills, and you can contribute your personal part to make this world a little better.

You should differentiate, not judge. Every dharma, every work, has its importance, value and qualities. An intellectual person is not better than a simple laborer – just different.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br/>The best way to fulfill your dharma is to invest your available energies, abilities and passion into your work. And if you want peace of mind, you have to learn the art of detaching yourself from the results of your activities. Why? Because you can’t determine the outcome of what you do: how will it be perceived by others; will it be a success or failure? 

The Bhagavad-Gita, India’s well-known spiritual book of wisdom, describes karma and dharma in several places. In the 2nd chapter, one of the many practical guidelines are offered by Krishna to his hesitating friend on the battlefield of life: “One who fulfills his duty with determination and love, yet has learned to remain undisturbed even when failing, is a true yogi, as he craves neither for success nor happiness. Such a person’s joy is nourished by inner wisdom, not by external results.” [paraphrased 2.55–57]
